        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Chili crab is a bold, flavorful dish that's a staple of Singaporean and Malaysian cuisine. This seafood delicacy features fresh crab (usually mud crab) cooked in a rich, savory, and slightly spicy tomato-based sauce. The sauce itself is a blend of chili, tomatoes, garlic, ginger, and tamarind, creating a tangy, sweet, and mildly spicy profile. The crab is typically stir-fried in the sauce, allowing the meat to soak up the delicious flavors while retaining its sweetness. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Often, the dish is served with mantou (fried buns) to dip into the flavorful sauce, making it a satisfying, hands-on meal. The richness of the sauce, combined with the sweet crab meat, creates a perfect balance of heat and sweetness — a true indulgence for those who love bold flavors.

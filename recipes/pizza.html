        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Italian pizza is known for its simplicity, freshness, and balance. It features a thin, chewy crust made from just flour, water, salt, and yeast, often cooked at very high temperatures in a wood-fired oven. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The toppings are light and carefully chosen: fresh tomato sauce, creamy mozzarella cheese, a few basil leaves, and a drizzle of olive oil. Unlike heavier American styles, Italian pizza highlights the natural flavors of its ingredients, resulting in a light, aromatic, and slightly smoky dish. Each bite captures the essence of Italian cooking — pure, honest, and deeply satisfying.

                    <li>Try not to press out all the air to keep the crust light and bubbly.</li>

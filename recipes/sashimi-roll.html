        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            A sashimi roll usually refers to a sushi roll that features sashimi-grade fish (raw fish like salmon, tuna, or yellowtail) but with a twist: the fish might be layered on top of the roll instead of inside, or sometimes the roll itself might be made mostly of fish without a lot of rice or seaweed.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's different from regular sashimi (which is just slices of raw fish) because a sashimi roll usually includes other ingredients like avocado, cucumber, or crab, rolled together with a little bit of rice and nori (seaweed) or sometimes even without seaweed, depending on the style.
        </p>

        <p> 
            It's basically the elegance of sashimi, combined with the creativity and structure of a sushi roll!
